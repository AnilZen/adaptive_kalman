The arguments of the class are\n N: Number of grid points. dt: Time step, defaults to 0.05. This is hard-coded for forecasts, so be careful when you change it. The error growth time scale is assumed to be such that 0.05 corresponds to 6 hours in an operational weather forecast system. forcing: External forcing function, defaults to a constant of 8 which is the chaotic regime.  The interior equations are implemented through the rhs method using vectorized numpy expressions.\ndotx[2:-1] = (x[3:]-x[0:-3])*x[1:-2] - x[2:-1] + forcing[2:-1] Periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the outer grid points.\nThe Lorenz-96 system is solved using the solve method, which takes the number of days and initial data as input. The method populates the sol attribute by integrating the system using a 4th order Runge-Kutta method\nself.sol[0] = init_data for i in range(1, self.nt+1): self.sol[i] = self.rk4(self.sol[i-1]) self.t += self.dt The total number of time steps nt is determined from the days and the time step via self.nt = int(4*0.05/self.dt*days) as dt=0.05 corresponds to 6 hours.\nAn animate method is provided to view the evolution of the solution in time.\n  Lorenz, E.N., 1996.
