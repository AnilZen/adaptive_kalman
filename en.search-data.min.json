[{"id":0,"href":"/adaptive_kalman/theory/lorenz-96/","title":"Lorenz-96 Model","parent":"Theory","content":"The Lorenz-96 model is a chaotic, continuous-in-time, discrete-in-space, dynamical system that was proposed by Lorenz in 1996 as a toy model for weather dynamics.1.\n$$ \\frac{dx_j}{dt} = ( x_{j+1} - x_{j-2} ) x_{j-1} - x_j + F. $$\nThe system is implemented in helpers.py in class Lorenz. The arguments of the class are\n N: Number of grid points. F: Constant external forcing term, defaults to 8 which is the chaotic regime. days, dt: The total number of time steps, nt, is determined from total days and the time step via self.nt = 4*0.05/dt*self.days. This setting is because the error growth time scale is assumed to be such that a dt of 0.05 corresponds to 6 hours in an operational weather forecast system. bias: Amplitude of bias. noise: Amplitude of noise. pert_type: Type of perturbation. Perturbation types are implemented through the method update_perturbation in the class. The implemented types are  \u0026quot;None\u0026quot;: No bias, corresponds to the Nature solution. \u0026quot;Bias\u0026quot;: A constant (in time and space) bias applied to all grid points with amplitude bias. Corresponds to a constant shift of theÂ forcing term. \u0026quot;Noise\u0026quot;: Normally distributed bias that varies randomly at each time step but is constant across the grid, implemented via np.random.normal(0., self.noise, self.N). \u0026quot;GridBias\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;TimeBias\u0026quot;:    The interior equations are implemented through the rhs method using vectorized numpy expressions.\ndotx[2:-1] = (x[3:]-x[0:-3])*x[1:-2] - x[2:-1] + self.F + \\ + self.pert[2:-1] Periodic boundary conditions are imposed on the outer grid points.\nThe Lorenz-96 system is solved using the solve method, which has an additional input init_data. The method populates the sol attribute by integrating the system with updated perturbations using a 4th order Runge-Kutta method\nself.sol[0] = init_data for i in range(1, self.nt+1): self.update_perturbation() self.sol[i] = self.rk4(self.sol[i-1]) An animate method is provided to view the evolution of the solution in time.\n  Lorenz, E.N., 1996.
